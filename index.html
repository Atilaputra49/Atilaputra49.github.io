The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing web application security. It provides free and open tools, security guidelines, and best practices to secure applications for developers, businesses, and security professionals. OWASP is significant in information security as it fosters a community-driven approach to identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities. It offers various tools such as OWASP Top 10, OWASP Dependency-Check, and OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy). Additionally, OWASP conducts training sessions, conferences, and awareness campaigns to educate developers and security professionals about emerging threats.
The OWASP Top 10 is a widely recognized standard that highlights the most critical security vulnerabilities affecting web applications. It is an invaluable resource for businesses as it identifies security flaws based on real-world application data, ensuring organizations prioritize addressing the most significant threats. Each vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10 is accompanied by a detailed explanation, methods of exploitation, and countermeasures. Organizations use this list to improve security awareness, support secure development practices, and comply with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS. By following OWASP recommendations, organizations can build secure applications and reduce the risk of cyberattacks.
The OWASP Top 10 is updated approximately every three to four years to reflect emerging security threats, evolving attack patterns, and industry trends. As technology advances, new vulnerabilities emerge, making regular updates essential for maintaining effective security practices. Updates are based on extensive security research, vulnerability intelligence, and industry input, ensuring that the list remains relevant and addresses the most significant cybersecurity challenges.

 Security risk that was selected  from the OWASP Top 10 for this task is Broken Access Control. A broken access control occurs when a user can perform an activity beyond what their user profile allows them. Reasons behind this include a policy of an application failing to set strict access limits on performing certain actions by authenticated users. If such policies are too permissive or completely non-existent, users can perform actions that they are not allowed to such as accessing other users' information, modifying sensitive data, gaining access as system administrators, and many other unsolicited activities. 

This vulnerability can be exploited via different means such as nullifying the authentication by changing the parameters of a particular request, associated cookies, or session tokens, or any other means of access that can grant permission to the system. Privilege escalation is a typical example of such means, which includes gaining higher access to a certain system or application through unsecure or weak control over access. Making an attacker's presence known by using random URL access that should normally be hidden is an example of forced browsing. Altering certain parameters in a request like user_id=123 and changing it to user_id=124 to grant access to another account with the aforementioned user ID is an example of Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). Subsequently, because of misconfiguration of the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, other domains can be enabled to request for any supplied resource, regardless of any limitation placed on them. Also, there is a failure of almost every application to impose permission controls over the calling of some backend features.

The consequences of broken access control can be extremely damaging. Attackers are able to capture sensitive information, including personal identities, financial details, and login information, which can result in significant identity theft. An unauthorized user can also tamper records, remove essential data, or modify an application into an ill-functioning one. That's not all. A privilege escalation attack can enable an attacker to assume control of the entire system at an administrative or equivalently superior level. Moreover, broken access control can result in non-compliance and legal violations that could lead to severe penalties and loss of customers for breaching important laws like GDPR or HIPAA.

There are several ways best practices can eliminate issues caused by broken access control. For starters, there is class-based role authorization control (RBAC) that allows users to perform functions in line with their positions while barring them from access to higher administrative functions unless permission is explicitly given. Access is also control device-enabled, location-based, and even time-based. An authentication and restriction/check is done at the server instead of the client-side. An automated external interface should not remain open and unguarded.

Two breach case studies highlight the critical need for strong security measures to prevent broken access control vulnerabilities. Case study one, In early 2025, security researchers Sam Curry and Shubham Shah discovered vulnerabilities in Subaru's website. These allowed attackers to remotely control vehicle functions, such as unlocking doors and starting the engine. Attackers also could be able to track vehicle location, visit sensitive locations, and expose customers' private movements, such as home addresses. The case study is directly related to OWASP broken access control because Subaru's website failed to implement strong and proper user authentication, leading to unauthorized access to vehicle control systems and sensitive user data. Allowed unauthorized users to bypass security  measures and control systems that should have been restricted. As a result, several best practices suggested to improve security and address broken access control vulnerabilities. First, implement strong access controls where Subaru's should have strict Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure that only the right user can access the information and functionalities relevant to their own cars. Applying a strong authentication mechanism by implementing Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) and secure authentication would reduce the risk of  unauthorized access. 

Next, case study two, Back In 2018, Facebook (then Meta) experienced a significant security incident due to unsuccessful access control, which exposed over 50 million userâ€™s personal information. The incident arose due to the vulnerability of the "View As" feature, where attackers had the ability to take advantage of access token weaknesses and access multiple accounts without proper authorization. This attack is a perfect example of OWASP threat type broken access control, illustrating the capability of attackers to privilege escalate due to poor permission enforcement. Preventative countermeasures such as proper validation of security controls and testing, heightened user awareness for account security and regular penetration testing, example like enabling two-factor authentication, would have mitigated the risk. Overall, the incident highlights the importance of increasing access control and ensuring user data privacy in web applications.

In conclusion, the case study examples show the serious risks of ignoring these weaknesses, including security breaches, compliance issues and harm to an organization's reputation. By implementing these strategies, organizations can defend against broken access control vulnerabilities and data from unauthorized access potential being exploited.
